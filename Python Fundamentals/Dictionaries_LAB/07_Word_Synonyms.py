"""Write a program, which keeps a dictionary with synonyms.
The key of the dictionary will be the word. The value will be
a list of all the synonyms of that word. You will be given a
number n – the count of the words. After each term, you will
be given a synonym, so the count of lines you should read from
the console is 2 * n. You will be receiving a word and a synonym
each on a separate line like this:

· {word}
· {synonym}

If you get the same word twice, just add the new synonym to the list.
Print the words in the following format:

{word} - {synonym1, synonym2 … synonymN}"""
