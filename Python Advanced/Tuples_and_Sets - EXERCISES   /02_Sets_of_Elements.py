"""Write a program that prints a set of elements. On the first line, you will receive two numbers - n and m, separated
by a single space - representing the lengths of two separate sets. On the next n + m lines, you will receive n numbers,
which are the numbers in the first set, and m numbers, which are in the second set. Find all the unique elements that
appear in both and print them on separate lines (the order does not matter).

For example:
Set with length n = 4: {1, 3, 5, 7}
Set with length m = 3: {3, 4, 5}
Set that contains all the elements that repeat in both sets -> {3, 5}"""

second_set = {input() for _ in range(second_count)}

for num in unique_numbers:
    print(num)
